# UpdatedPortfolio

- This project was to update our portfolio to display our resumes and previous class projects. I wanted to test out new css I have been learning to create a great design that I could be proud of. I used materialize and leared how to use parallax containers to display a photo in the background and have text roll over it. As well as creating a full page carousel.

- When going through my portfolio go ahead and click on a few things to test out their functions! My resume will zoom to full size when clicked on and all links to my email, projects, and profiles are working correctly so go check them out! As well and the nav bar, it will take you to my two pages.
